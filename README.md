# workDayPlanner

## Description
In this assignment we were given some starting HTML and CSS styles for a Daily Planner app that allows the user to add things they need to do for the day to the planner 
in hour increments of the work day (9AM - 6PM). The calendar shows if a certain hour long block of time (e.g. 9AM-10AM) is in the past, present, or future based on the coloring of that
section of the planner. The user can save the data they've input by clicking the save button to persist their data across page refreshes. This activity involved using the Bootstrap
grid system to get the layout, the Moment.js library to set and compare times, CSS for styling, HTML to add additional elements to the page, and javascript for local storage and 
general app logic.
